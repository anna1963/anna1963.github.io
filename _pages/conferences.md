Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks for implicit regularization
======
Advancing Earth and Space Science (AGU23) [awarded the Outstanding Student Presentation Awards (OSPA)]
Anran Xu, Lindsey Justine Heagy and John Weis, University of British Columbia

You can find poster and video presentation in the OSPA Winners's gallery: https://agu23.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=ospa-2024-winners-gallery, by searching "LEVERAGING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS FOR IMPLICIT REGULARIZATION IN DC RESISTIVITY INVERSIONS". This work was published in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, and you can find the link to the paper in the "Publications" section.
